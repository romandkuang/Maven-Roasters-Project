# Maven Roasters Project

## Project Background and Overview
Maven Roasters is a specialty coffee shop chain with three locations in New York City—Astoria, Hell’s Kitchen, and Lower Manhattan—offering premium coffee, tea, and baked goods. I'm partnering with the Head of Operations to analyze performance data and provide strategic recommendations to enhance sales, optimize product offerings, and refine marketing strategies across all three locations.

This analysis focuses on uncovering purchase behaviors, identifying sales trends, and pinpointing opportunities for revenue growth. Additionally, we aim to improve operational efficiency by optimizing staffing and inventory management. 
<br><br>By leveraging interactive dashboards and data-driven insights, we will enable smarter business decisions and opportunities that drive sales and streamline daily operations.
<br><br>Insights and recommendations are based on the following key business metrics:
###
<B>	Transaction Volume:</b> Number of daily sales transactions across all locations
<Br><b> Revenue Performance:</b> Total revenue generated per store and product category
<Br><b> Customer Traffic Patterns:</b> Sales trends by time of day and day of the week
<Br><b>Product Performance:</b> Top-selling and least-selling products in each location

## Executive Summary
Maven Roaster's sales analysis of 149K transactions over a 6-month period reveals a total revenue of $700K across three locations, with tea, coffee, and espresso being the top three product types at all locations. Peak sales occur in the morning hours (7-10 AM), but February and June show a decline in performance across all locations. Additionally, there is a noticeable decline in sales after 10 AM, presenting an opportunity for operational adjustments. By optimizing staffing levels, introducing new menu items, and launching targeted promotions, Maven Roaster can drive increased customer traffic and sales during slower periods, ultimately enhancing overall performance and boosting revenue.
