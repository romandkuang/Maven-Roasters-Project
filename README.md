# Maven Roasters Project

## Project Background and Overview
Maven Roasters is a specialty coffee shop chain with three locations in New York City—Astoria, Hell’s Kitchen, and Lower Manhattan—offering premium coffee, tea, and baked goods. I'm partnering with the Head of Operations to analyze performance data and provide strategic recommendations to enhance sales, optimize product offerings, and refine marketing strategies across all three locations.

This analysis focuses on uncovering purchase behaviors, identifying sales trends, and pinpointing opportunities for revenue growth. Additionally, we aim to improve operational efficiency by optimizing staffing and inventory management. By leveraging interactive dashboards and data-driven insights, we will enable smarter business decisions and opportunities that drive sales and streamline daily operations.
Insights and recommendations are based on the following key business metrics:
###
<B>	Transaction Volume:</b> Number of daily sales transactions across all locations
<Br><b> Revenue Performance:</b> Total revenue generated per store and product category
<Br><b> Customer Traffic Patterns:</b> Sales trends by time of day and day of the week
<Br><b>Product Performance:</b> Top-selling and least-selling products in each location
