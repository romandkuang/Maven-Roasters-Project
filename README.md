# Maven Roasters Project

## Project Background and Overview
Maven Roasters is a specialty coffee shop chain with three locations in New York City—Astoria, Hell’s Kitchen, and Lower Manhattan—offering premium coffee, tea, and baked goods. I'm partnering with the Head of Operations to analyze performance data and provide strategic recommendations to enhance sales, optimize product offerings, and refine marketing strategies across all three locations.
This analysis focuses on uncovering purchase behaviors, identifying sales trends, and pinpointing opportunities for revenue growth. Additionally, we aim to improve operational efficiency by optimizing staffing and inventory management.

By leveraging interactive dashboards and data-driven insights, we will enable smarter business decisions and opportunities that drive sales and streamline daily operations.

<br>Insights and recommendations are based on the following key business metrics:
### 
<B>Total Transaction Volume:</b> Daily sales transactions across all locations
<Br><b>Monthly Revenue Performance (MoM Trends):</b> Total revenue generated per store month-over-month identifying trends
<Br><b> Hourly and Daily Sales Trends:</b> Identifying peak and low-traffic periods throughout the week 
<Br><b>Product Performance:</b> Top and bottom performing products by location

## Executive Summary
Maven Roaster's sales analysis, based on 149K transactions over a 6-month period (Jan – June 2023), reveals a total revenue of $700K across three locations. Revenue is relatively evenly distributed among the three locations, with Hell's Kitchen leading at 33.84%, followed by Astoria at 33.23%, and Lower Manhattan at 32.92%.
Tea, coffee, and espresso emerge as the top three product categories at all locations, consistently driving the highest sales. 
The analysis indicates that peak sales occur during the morning hours (7-10 AM), with a noticeable decline in performance throughout February across all locations. Furthermore, sales show a significant drop after 10 AM, highlighting an opportunity for operational improvement.
To address these trends, Maven Roaster can optimize staffing levels to ensure sufficient coverage during peak hours and explore opportunities to introduce new menu items that cater to customer preferences. 
Additionally, launching targeted promotions and specials during off-peak periods could help increase traffic and sales throughout the day. By taking these actions, Maven Roaster can enhance overall business performance, maximize revenue, and better meet customer demand.

## Recommendations
<b>Based on the insights and findings above, we would recommend the stakeholder team to consider the following: </b>
<br><br><b>Target High-Value Products:</b>
<br>•<b>	Leverage Popularity:</b> Focus on top-selling products such as Brewed Chai Tea and Barista Espresso, which have consistently strong sales across locations. Emphasizing these items in local promotions or marketing campaigns can attract more customers and drive foot traffic. By highlighting the popularity of these products, you can create a sense of urgency and excitement around them.

<br>•<b>	Bundling and Special Offers:</b> On busier days, consider bundling top-selling products with other complementary items, such as pastries or other beverages, to increase the overall transaction value and focus on upselling. This can encourage customers to purchase more items, boosting both sales and customer satisfaction. 
<br><br>
On slower days, offer a Buy One Get One Free (BOGO) deal on product products to encourage bulk purchases and increase sales volume. This type of promotion encourages customers to try new items or purchasing more.



<br>
<b>Staffing Optimization and Adjust Inventory:</b>
<br>•	Allocate more staff during peak hours to improve customer experience and reduce waiting time. During low-traffic hours, consider adjusting staffing levels to optimize costs. 
<br>•	Adjust Inventory for Peak days and Slow days. Ensure high-demand products are sufficiently stocked and provide bundling offers on busy days. Reduce stock on low-demand products and highlight discounts and promotions for those items. If bottom-performing products consistently underperform, consider removing them from the menu or replacing them with more popular options. 


## Clarifying Questions, Assumptions, and Caveats

<br>•	<b>Missing Monthly Data:</b> The dataset only includes sales transactions from January to June. The lack of data from July onwards may limit the ability to capture seasonal trends, longer-term performance, or shifts in customer behavior beyond this period.

<br>•	<b>Lack of Promotional Data:</b> The sales data does not indicate whether specific promotions or discounts were active during particular periods. This makes it difficult to attribute changes in transaction volume or sales patterns to promotional activities.

<br>•	<b>Blank Data for Transactions (6 AM & 8 PM in Astoria):</b> The data shows no transactions at 6 AM and 8 PM in Astoria. These gaps were assumed to be due to the store being closed during these hours. Further clarification would be needed if this assumption is incorrect.
